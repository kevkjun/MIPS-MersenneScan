Program:
	- Contains all functions from project description
	- Four data segment Bigint(s) are utilized for intermediary storage of mult_big, pow_big, sub_big, and mod_big
	- Interfaces have been changed for mult_big, sub_big, and mod_big:
		- Bigint a is passed by reference
		- Return Bigint writes over Bigint a
	- pow_big is stored in data segment big_int2 - address to big_int2 is returned in $v0

Running:
	- Load and run in QtSpim as normal
	- Test cases written in main function
	- Test case results print to console
